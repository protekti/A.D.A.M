A.D.A.M. (Autonomous Driving and Assistance Model) is an intelligent self-driving system designed to deliver safe, efficient, and adaptive autonomous driving experiences. Leveraging real-time data processing and machine learning, A.D.A.M. continuously learns from its environment, adjusts to road and traffic conditions, and prioritizes passenger comfort and safety. With a focus on dynamic decision-making and precision, A.D.A.M. aims to redefine the standards of autonomous mobility by providing reliable, human-centered assistance on every journey.

***THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN ITS SIMLATOR STAGES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR REAL SCENARIOS.***

## Types
As of now there are 2 different types of A.D.A.M.. There is the OPENCV branch which utilises AI for car detection as well as distance aproximation but the AI branch is 100% AI. The AI branch is still in heavy development and is still undergoing major changes.

## Installation

As of now there is no official instalation instruction as the current code is in PRE-ALPHA stages meaning that the code isnt stable enough for proper use.

## Support
